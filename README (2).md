# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Diabetic retinopathy is a threatening complication of diabetes that leads to permanent blindness
if left untreated. One of the essential challenges is early detection, which is very important for successful treatment. Unfortunately, identification of diabetic retinopathy requires an expert.

The use Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) can automate DR screening speeding up the detection and decision-making process, which will help to control or manage DR progression
